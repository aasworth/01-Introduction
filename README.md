In main.py, I have answered all the questions for this assignment in the best way I could. I started with my name then went through and said what my favorite games are, the concerns I have for this class and what i am excited about for this class and this semester. At the end I quoted what my stackoverflow.com user ID is and the link to my github.com profile. The program works to my liking and is easy to read what I have printed with it.

The grading criteria will be as follows:

* [1 point] Assignment turned in on time
* [1] Repository contains an appropriate software license
